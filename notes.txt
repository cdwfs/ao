add a block.
update all neighboring points (could be clever, but for now, enh.)
for each point:
  query its 8 neighbors.
  for each empty neighbor, compute full AO factor for octant. Otherwise, octant factor is 0.
  for each non-empty neighbor:
    for each of three faces at this point:
	  add up the 4 octant AO factors in the direction of the face normal
	  update vertex color of appropriate face vertex

cubeGeometry.updateVertexAO(octant (Vector3), normal (Vector3? channel?), newAO)

current: 64x64x64 cells
 - 65x65x65 points
 - 24 verts per cell (could potentially share each vert with 4 cells)
 - well-packed: 8 bytes per vert (3 pos, 2 uv, 1 norm, 2 misc.)
 - 48 MB vertex buffer, 6M vertices. Guess you can't just render
   everything!
 - with geometry shaders, make that 3 bytes + 12 bytes + 5 bytes per cell.

current plan: move AoCubeGeometry into voxelgrid, and put one in every
cell. 16x16x4 cells = 24.5K verts
